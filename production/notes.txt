Project name (proposed): How Do I Live?

Idea:
The main idea for this project is to record things I do everyday. Because, sometimes I'll end the day
asking how I survived based on what I ate, how much I slept, or other factors. Sometimes, it doesn't
feel right that I'm still alive with how self-destructive I can get, so this data will be a deep dive 
into that question: how do I live?

Sample data set:

let day1 = {
    meal{
        time: 0.0,
        food: [food1, food2, food3],
        feeling: function(notfood){
            let stomachcap = [0, 1];
            let notfood = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2);
            if(notfood == 0){
                console.log("feeling good");
                return;
            }
            if(notfood == 1){
                console.log("feeling weird");
                return;
            }
        },
    },
    sleep{
        time: 7.5,
        disturbances: 2,
        feeling: funtion(sleeptime){
            let hours = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
            sleeptime = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5);

            if(sleeptime == 0){
                console.log("feeling woozy");
                return;
            };

            if(sleeptime == 1){
                console.log("feeling tired");
                return;
            };

            //and so on

        }
    },
    social{
        time: 2.75,
        people: [name1, name2, name3],
        feeling: function(talktime){
            let hours = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];
            talktime = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5);

            if(talktime == 0){
                console.log("battery 100%");
                return;
            };

            if(talktime == 1){
                console.log("battery 75%");
                return;
            };

            //and so on
        }
    },

    //and more if i can think of some more factors

}

// console.log() can be changed with other things that can execute for final version
