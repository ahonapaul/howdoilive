Project name (proposed): How Do I Live?

Idea:
The main idea for this project is to record things I do everyday. Because, sometimes I'll end the day
asking how I survived based on what I ate, how much I slept, or other factors. Sometimes, it doesn't
feel right that I'm still alive with how self-destructive I can get, so this data will be a deep dive 
into that question: how do I live?

- how is the data going to be displayed
    - randomise an output, display when mouseover the element
        (run the feeling function on hover everytime)
        (tie together feeling function with the other parameters)
    - click to explore stat
        (have a page with all the potential options)
        (link to other stat pages)
